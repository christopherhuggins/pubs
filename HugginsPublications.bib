  title     = {Arranging and Conducting Elite Interviews: Practical Considerations},
  abstract  = {Elite interviewing is an established research method in the social sciences. It offers researchers a number of advantages, particularly when the motivations and perceptions of participants are the subject of inquiry. I used elite interviews in my research on local government transnational networking. While I was confident this approach was well suited to the aims of my study, I remained uncertain about the practicalities involved in arranging and conducting interviews, and I was afraid that such practical aspects would have a detrimental impact on the reliability of my results. This case outlines the practical issues I faced when arranging and conducting interviews. This highlights the importance of these practical considerations in the success of elite interviews, in addition to its methodological suitability to a study.},

  abstract = "In England the new Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) were given a unique opportunity to shape EU investment in their local areas; they were given the task of producing European Structural and Investment Funds strategies to help ensure EU investment meets local need. However, while this appears to be a case of localism in action, the LEPs faced a number of constraints. These challenges include LEPs' relative infancy, a lack of capacity, centralisation and uncertainty about funding arrangements.},

  title     = {Subnational transnational networking and the continuing process of local-level Europeanization},
  abstract  = {One of the features of local-level Europeanization has been the emergence of transnational networking (TN) undertaken by subnational authorities (SNAs). This activity, which received much attention during the 1990s, enables SNAs to take advantage of the opportunities created by European integration. However, empirical analyses of TN are lacking, despite European integration and the wider context SNAs find themselves within evolving. Consequently, little remains understood about how SNAs engage in TN and how they are affected by Europeanization pressures. Using the case of TN undertaken by SNAs in South East England and Northern France, this article finds that Europeanization has created more opportunities for SNAs to engage at the European level. SNAs have, in turn, taken advantage of these opportunities, leading to increased participation in TN. However, SNAs' approaches to TN are not uniform. Engagement remains marked by differentiation as local-level factors, such as local strategy and political objectives, affect how SNAs participate in TN. This differentiation is likely to become increasingly marked as SNAs respond to contemporary challenges, such as budgetary pressures and, in the case of South East England, Brexit.},

  author = {Huggins, Christopher},
  abstract = {Brexit presents English local authorities with significant uncertainties. This is particularly the case with EU regional policy, which, in a context of political centralization and budgetary pressures, has become an important means for local authorities to undertake projects in their local areas. While local authorities were relatively quiet during the referendum campaign, there is now concern about the long-term future and availability of regional policy support. Thisarticle offers an initial survey of local authorities' role during the campaign and their attempts to influence post-Brexit regional policy. It shows that local authorities' attempts to engage in these debates, both before and after the referendum campaign, have been hampered by inherent centralization in the English political system.},

  title     = {Subnational government and transnational networking: the rationalist logic of local level Europeanization},
  abstract  = {The involvement of subnational actors in EU politics has become an increasingly recognized facet of European integration. However, this highlights an interesting puzzle: subnational authorities in unitary and centralized polities usually lack the formal competence and have limited resources to engage beyond their territorial limits. Why, then, do they engage at the European level? This article addresses this question by exploring their motivations for participation in European transnational networking. These motivations are assessed against a Europeanization framework, exploring whether subnational authorities adopt the 'logic of consequentialism' or the 'logic of appropriateness' when engaging in transnational networking. The article argues that subnational authorities are rational actors, maximizing the opportunities presented by the EU without subscribing to its normative aims. In a context marked by financial pressures and Brexit, these findings provide a useful foundation for analyzing the on‚Äêgoing EU--local relationship, and for explaining changes to subnational authorities' approaches to European engagement.},
